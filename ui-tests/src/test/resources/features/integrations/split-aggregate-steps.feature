Feature: Integration - DB to DB with split/aggregate

  Background: Clean application state
    Given clean application state
    And log into the Syndesis
    And reset content of "todo" table

  @aggregate

  Scenario: Split and aggregate integration flow

    When inserts into "todo" table
      | task1 |
      | task1 |
      | task1 |

    When navigate to the "Home" page
    And click on the "Create Integration" link to create a new integration.
    Then check visibility of visual integration editor
    And check that position of connection to fill is "Start"

        # select SQL connection as 'from' point
    When select the "PostgresDB" connection
    And select "Periodic SQL invocation" integration action
        #Then check visibility of page "Periodic SQL Invocation"
    Then check "Next" button is "Disabled"
    When fill in invoke query input with "DELETE FROM todo WHERE task='finalTask'" value
    And fill in period input with "10" value
    And select "Seconds" from sql dropdown
    And click on the "Next" button

        # select postgresDB connection as 'to' point
    Then check visibility of page "Choose a Finish Connection"
    When select the "PostgresDB" connection
    And select "Invoke SQL" integration action
    And fill in invoke query input with "INSERT INTO todo(task) VALUES ('finalTask')" value
    And click on the "Next" button

        # add DB step Select
    # Then check visibility of page "Add to Integration"
    When add integration step on position "0"
    And select "PostgresDB" integration step
    And select "Invoke SQL" integration action
    And fill in periodic query input with "SELECT * FROM todo WHERE task='task1'" value
    And click on the "Next" button

        # add Split step
    # Then check visibility of page "Add to Integration"
    When add integration step on position "1"
    And select "Split" integration step
    And click on the "Next" button

        # add DB step Insert
    # Then check visibility of page "Add to Integration"
    When add integration step on position "2"
    And select "PostgresDB" integration step
    And select "Invoke SQL" integration action
    And fill in invoke query input with "INSERT INTO todo(task) VALUES ('startTask')" value
    And click on the "Next" button

        # add DB step Delete
    # Then check visibility of page "Add to Integration"
    When add integration step on position "3"
    And select "PostgresDB" integration step
    And select "Invoke SQL" integration action
    And fill in invoke query input with "DELETE FROM todo WHERE task='task1'" value
    And click on the "Next" button

        # add Aggregate step
    # Then check visibility of page "Add to Integration"
    When add integration step on position "4"
    And select "Aggregate" integration step
    And click on the "Next" button
