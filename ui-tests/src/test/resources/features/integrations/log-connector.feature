    Then click on the "Done" button

    When click on the "Save" button
    And set integration name "Integration_with_log"
    And publish integration
    Then Integration "Integration_with_log" is present in integrations list
    And wait until integration "Integration_with_log" gets into "Running" state

    When sleep for "10000" ms
    Then validate that logs of integration "integration_with_log" contains string "<log_contains>"

      | true    | true  | Body: [[{"last_name":"Jackson", | "status":"done","failed":true |
      | false   | true  | Body: [[{"last_name":"Jackson", | Message Context:              |
      | true    | false | Message Context:                | Body: []                      |
