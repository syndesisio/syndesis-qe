# Concur credentials callback can be only changed by concur support, to test it
# one must install syndesis with --route=syndesis.my-minishift.syndesis.io and
# redirect this route to correct minishift/openshift IP via /etc/hosts file.
#
# I am also not able to create verification steps, because communication would
# go through concur WS and we have different credentials for that and they point
# to another concur instance thus not able to validate what our oauth credentials
# created. For more information ask kstam@redhat.com as he said it is not possible
# to have oauth and ws credentials to point to the same developer instance.
#

@ui
# Until the issue with @concur support is resolved, concur testing will be disabled.
