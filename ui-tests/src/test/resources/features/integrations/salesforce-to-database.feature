#    THIS "combine step" is temporary commented out.
#    It works separately but not in combination with below "separate step".
#    UNTIL ids for datamapper input fields are available. It has no meaning to spend a lot of time
#    to find magic css selector combination to identify these fields:
#    And she combines "FirstName" as "2" with "LastName" as "1" to "first_and_last_name" using "Space [ ]" separator

      #   B. Many steps: --START
      # # And create mapping from "FirstName" to "first_and_last_name"
      # Then fill in "FirstCombine" selector-input with "FirstName" value
      # And select "Combine" from "ActionSelect" selector-dropdown
      # And select "Space" from "SeparatorSelect" selector-dropdown
      # # Then check visibility of the "Add Source" button #this 'button' is 'link' in fact, see issue: 1156.
      # # And click on the "Add Source" button #for the time being keep 'link', see issue 1156
      # And click on the "Add Source" link
      # Then fill in "SecondCombine" selector-input with "LastName" value
      # And fill in "FirstCombinePosition" selector-input with "2" value
      # And fill in "SecondCombinePosition" selector-input with "1" value
      # Then fill in "TargetCombine" selector-input with "first_and_last_name" value
      #   B. Many steps: --END

#    And sleep for "12000" ms
    # And scroll "top" "right"
    And click on the "Done" button
      # finish and save integration
    And click on the "Save" link

    And set integration name "Salesforce to PostresDB E2E"
    And publish integration
      # wait for integration to get in active state
    Then wait until integration "Salesforce to PostresDB E2E" gets into "Running" state
#    VALIDATION:
    And create SF lead with first name: "Karol1", last name: "Stieranka1", email: "test@salesfoce-to-database.feature" and company: "Istrochem"
    # give it more time to propagate lead from sf to db
    And sleep for jenkins delay or "15" seconds
    And validate DB created new lead with first name: "Karol1", last name: "Stieranka1", email: "test@salesfoce-to-database.feature"
#    And remove all records from table "todo"
    Given clean SF, removes all leads with email: "test@salesfoce-to-database.feature"
